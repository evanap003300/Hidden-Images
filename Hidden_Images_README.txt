DESCRIPTION: This project disiphers hidden messages in images
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I have neither given nor received help on this test/assignment. Evan Phillips.
HOWTO: Put the code into a IDE such as Thonny and press the run button. You will also need all the mystery.ppm images as well as the graphics.py file in the same folder as Hidden_Images.py.
INPUT FILES: mystery1.ppm, mystery2.ppm, mystery3.ppm, mystery4.ppm, mystery5.ppm, graphics.py
OUTPUT FILE: mystery1_OutA01.ppm, mystery2_OutA02.ppm, mystery3_OutA03.ppm, mystery4_OutA04.ppm, mystery5_OutA05.ppm
BIBLIOGRAPHY: I refrenced the power point slides on files and strings.

REFLECTION: This assignment took me around two hours and a half to complete. One problem I had was figuring out how the parameters were supposed to use. I overcame this by rereading the instructions and testing diffrent things before I figured out that I needed to call each function inside of a loop based on the algorithm that I was inputted.
